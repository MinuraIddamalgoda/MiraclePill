I was following Devslope's guide on iOS frontend development but became bored and went off on my own tangent. 

* Changed how the states were picked
  * Now using a popup view on the same ViewController as the main app
  * Programatically added a blur effect in the background to help differentiate the popup view

* Added Labels and UITextViews to their own stacks in order for the app to scale better
  * Also easier to change the app as it's now more modular
